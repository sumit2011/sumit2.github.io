Introduction: Single linked list is a linear data structure. It is slightly different from array. It made by the nodes, each nodes consist a data and the address of the next node and each node are linked using pointers. Here data are not stored in the contiguous memory location, nodes are present anywhere in the memory space but every nodes are linked with eachother that’s why we call this linked list. Main benefit of linked list is that we can insert or delete data from any position in the list.

The class has three properties: arr (a pointer to an integer array to store the stack elements), top (an integer to represent the index of the topmost element in the stack), and size (an integer specifying the maximum capacity of the stack). Also, the class has a constructor that takes an integer size as a parameter and initializes the properties accordingly. The constructor allocates memory for the stack using the new keyword, sets the stack size, and initializes top to -1 to indicate that the stack is initially empty. //array emplementation of stack #include\u003ciostream\u003e using namespace std; class stack { //properties public: int *arr; int top; int size; //behaviour stack(int size) { this -\u003e size = size; arr = new int[size]; top=-1; } }; ","date":"15-01-2023","objectID":"/stack/:2:0","tags":["C","C++"],"title":"Stack (array implementation)","uri":"/stack/"},{"categories":["DSA"],"content":"Push Function The push function is part of the stack class.
